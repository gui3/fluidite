## <a name="principle"></a>principle
*fluiditÃ© should be a markup language
not as simple as markdown,
but more permissive :
you sould be able to write almost
anything you want and render as such,
for example an ASCI bar.\
#hashtags and @citations
are meant to be part of the language itself*

## <a name="example"></a>example
```
:h1> this is a h1 title with class ._fluidite

:hLine;
above this should be a line

you need to go to @web:https://thisPage;
or to search for some #hashtags;

:/this will not appear in html,
but this page has an author :
#author:: guillaume3 #; /;

:x this is a true comment,
 i can write anything x;

some text :x> same here, but it's an endline comment

:htmlSection
  <p>this section is rendered as is<br/>
  spaces and
  backspaces
  are ignored here</p>
htmlSection;

```

## <a name="generalRules"></a>general rules
*let's write OK by the time a rule works*

### <a name="renderAll"></a>"render all" rule
all words, characters and spaces are rendered as is, 
outside of interpreted functions

### <a name="machineCall"></a>"machine call" rule
words that need interpretation, 
to be translated in something else than the word itself,
need to be called with :word and closed with word;
- to call variable or function F you call **:F argument F;**
- to call variable or function F without argument **:F;**
functions return html (or any chosen rendering langage)\
**notable exceptions**\
#hastags and @at words,
see specific rules.

### <a name="separateWords"></a>"separate words" rule
to be interpreted, words must be separated
with at least one invisible (space, backspace, tab)
or one non-word character ( : ; / ( ) , ...)
**notable exceptions**\
:' :" :/ and :x at least can be joined to another word,
see specific rules.

### <a name="closePriority"></a>"close priority" rule
when a machine call is closed with call; or any closing tag,
all tags open since the call of this function are closed too,
there is no tresspassing between arguments.
ex :
```
:h1 this title is :em italic till the end h1;
this text is not italic anymore
```

## <a name="specificRules"></a>specific rules
*same with OK*

### <a name="hashtags"></a># hashtags
```#name;``` or ```#: name with spaces #;```\
creates either
- a link to adress **(current page)/hashtag?name%20with%20spaces**
- a link to function ```_fluidite.hashtag("name with spaces");```\
depending of fluidite core properties defined by ...you

### <a name="ats"></a>@ at links
```@ref;``` or ```@ref: options @;```\
creates either
- a link to adress **https://ref?options**
- a link to function ```_fluidite.at(ref, options);```\
depending of fluidite core properties defined by ...you again

### <a name="properties"></a>properties
**#name :: definition #;**
stores "definition" into the variable "name"\
that can be called later with ":name;"

### <a name="invisibles"></a>invisibles
All invisibles (spaces, tab, backspaces) are rendered,
for instance backspaces are translated as <br/> in html,
and a sequel of 4 spaces like this "&nbsp; &nbsp "\
*One out of two spaces must be a basic space 
otherwise word wrapping does not work*\

by default, invisibles that are 
at the beginning and the end of an argument
are not rendered :
```
:text
  <-text start here
    these spaces and
      backspaces are taken
 but not those who follow
      the arrow ->

text;
```

[=> top](#top)

### <a name="citations"></a>:' citations ';
to begin or end an argument with invisibles
one must use :' ';\
this function is one of the few
that don't need an invisible after
(to be a separated word)
```
:text
:'    <- these spaces
    are part of the argument
  and so do these backspaces ->

';
text;
```

### <a name="fullText"></a>:" full text citations ":
calls like :hello; are still translated inside :' ';,
to make a text full text, use  :" ";\
This function is the second not to need a separated word
```
:text
  :':hello; will call the object "hello"';
  :":hello; will here just be written as ":hello;"
  you can also call anything here with no danger
  like #; @; or #hello;";
```

### <a name="softComs"></a>:/ soft comments /;
to **hide** something from the renderer,
but still have the content **interpreted**,
one should use :/ /;
```
this text appear
:/ this text is hidden but :hello; is called /;
```

### <a name="hardComs"></a>:x hard comments x;
to comment, with **no render AND no interpretation**,
one should use :x x;
```
this is text :x this is comment x;
```

### <a name="endLines"></a>:f> endline functions
one that would be very nice,
:F> would take the end of line and send it to F
```
:h2> this is a title
this is text :x> this is an endline comment
```

# <a name="next"></a>What's next (to-do list)
there's all to do at the moment,
come back later for a real to-do list.
